NEW ADVANCED CIVICS
A small collection of impactful civics that will hopefully shape gameplay in substantial ways. The idea of an "advanced civic" is that it is more complex than most civics in the base game. In most cases, this means that it will include several advantages and some disadvantages. In a few cases, this means that there are special in-game abilities or events that are unavailable otherwise. The hope is that these civics will alter the way you play the game. 

1. New Civics

Shapers (Not Essentialists or Artificers) - In the philosophical-ideological dispute over the value of knowledge, this society ultimately decided that it is life that matters most to living beings, and its careful cultivation is the highest purpose of knowledge. (+15% food output, -10% genetic modification cost, +5% habitability, -5% non-society research)

Artificers (Not Essentialists or Shapers) - In the philosophical-ideological dispute over the value of knowledge, this society ultimately decided that the things sapient beings create, their tools and crafts, that matter most. (-10% ship upgrade cost, +10% robot output, +10% robot build speed, -5% non-engineering research)

Essentialists (Not Artificers or Shapers) - In the philosophical-ideological dispute over the value of knowledge, this society ultimately decided that solving the deepest and most abstract mysteries of the very fabric of reality are the true purpose of knowledge. (+15% sensor range and FTL speed, -5% non-physics research)

Figurehead Monarchy (Not Imperial) - This society's government technically has a monarchy, but the monarch wields only indirect power, mostly through cultural influence, and is a useful (if expensive) unifying figure. (+10% unity and influence production, -10% unrest, -5% energy and mineral production)

Exotic Graces (Fanatic Xenophile or Pacifist and Xenophile) - This culture has made it not just a point of basic etiquette but a matter of correct ethical behavior to understand and embrace foreign ways. This can be an expensive and sometimes disruptive tendency. (+2.5% other species happiness, +25% xeno migration attraction, -5% tradition cost per alien species, +5% trade attractiveness, +1% unity per federation member, -10% governing ethos attraction, +10% consumer goods use)

Sortition (Democratic and Egalitarian, no Republicanism, Figurehead Monarchy, Meritocracy, or Technocracy) - This society believes so strongly in the equality of all its citizens and the need to curb accumulations of power that it selects its leadership randomly. While there are elections for important positions, the candidates are actually chosen by lot. (Leader pool size +2, leader capacity +5, leader influence cost -25%, happiness +10%, election influence cost +100%)

Special Features:
-A number of special leader traits that can be randomly assigned to leaders on generation and may change over time: Unready (slower leveling and worse at job), Groomed for Office (slower leveling and better at job), Advising Tutors (faster leveling and worse at job), and Ambitious (faster leveling and better at job).
-Ostracization events targeting Ambitious leaders.

Otherworldly (Fanatic Materialist or Fanatic Spiritualist) - This civilization seems nearly insane from an outside perspective. It's speculated that they made a discovery that broke them, socially, culturally, and psychologically. It is as if they no longer truly belong in this universe. Needless to say, dealing with them is very difficult, but they may prove useful if any outside context problems show up. (+10% FTL speed, -5% anomaly fail chance, +10% anomaly find chance, -10% trade attractiveness and trust growth, +10% diplomatic influence cost)

Special Features:
-"Revelation" leader traits granting bonuses in their job fields. These can be randomly assigned when leaders are spawned, or generated from a ~spooky~ event chain.
-"Forbidden Lore" techs that provide bonus damage against leviathans and crisis ships, refund their tech point cost when researched, and provide a unity generation bonus for researching.

Aspiring Ascendants (Any fanatical ethos) - This civilization has ardent convictions and grandiose ambitions. They believe, with a solar intensity, that their values are meant to be written in the laws of the universe. They intend to carve them there or burn out trying. (+10% governing ethos attraction and unity production, -15% terraform cost and completion time, -10% megastructure cost and build time, +10% governing ethics attraction penalty due to distance, expansion influence cost, and expansion effect on Tradition cost.)

Special Features:
-"War of Audacity" edict (+15% damage vs. Fallen and Awakened Empires, costs 1 influence per month)
-Special "Aspiration" ascension perk granting progress towards high-level techs and an immediate second ascension perk pick. Unlocked by completing specific traditions according to the empire's fanatic ethos: Diplomacy (Xenophile or Pacifist), Discovery (Xenophile or Materialist), Domination (Spiritualist or Authoritarian), Expansion (Materialist, Xenophobe, or Militarist), Harmony (Egalitarian or Spiritual), Prosperity (Egalitarian or Pacifist), Supremacy (Militarist, Xenophobe, or Authoritarian).

Techno-Barbarism (Spiritualist, Authoritarian) - The superstitious heirs to an advanced civilization, they have forgotten more of science than most empires ever discover. Unfortunately, they remember little and misunderstand much of that. Fortunately, their technology was designed very well. (-10% building upkeep and cost, +15% army damage and health, -1 research alternative)

Special Features:
-Ability (and obligation!) to undertake special salvage missions that can provide great rewards at high risks.
-Unique Ancient Ruins building on homeworld that can be enhanced by salvage missions... or destroyed to reform your empire's culture.
-Loot technology points or capture alien scientists when invading a planet.
-"Techno-Ritual Piety" policies that operate on a sliding scale with slow research and build speed but more powerful ships at the start, but less slow research but no bonuses or penalties to ship strength or any build speed on the other end. New policies are unlocked over time. 
--Full (Default): +15% ship HP, shields, armor, evasion, and damage; -30% ship build speed, -15% building and army build speed, -10% research speed, +20% scientist recruit cost.
--Lapsed: +10% ship HP, shields, armor, evasion, and damage; -20% ship build speed, -10% building and army build speed, +5% emergency FTL damage, -7.5% research speed, +15% scientist recruit cost.
--Token: +5% ship HP, shields, armor, evasion, and damage; -10% ship build speed, -5% building and army build speed, +10% emergency FTL damage, -5% research speed, +10% scientist recruit cost.
--None: +15% emergency FTL damage, -2.5% research speed, +5% scientist recruit cost, +1 research alternative.

2. New Governments

The more complex and flavorful civic additions come with their own new government types. 

Techno-Barbarian Governments

Cyber-Shaman Conclave: This government is a loose collection of tribes united in their veneration of old ruins and the holy relic tech within. Their most skilled interpreters of the signs and sounds and instruction manuals of ancient technology guide the society's industry and salvage-research.
-Ruler: Chief Cyber-Seer

Machine Cult: This government is a kind of cargo-cult church of relic technology. The cyber-clergy enforce the strict rites of usage and repair necessary to safely operate the old devices. Oddly, for some reason all the successful rituals contain the instruction 'press the ON button' at some point.
-Ruler: Technophant

Devicomancer Dynasty: This government is centered on a family line of 'devicomancers' who posses vast holdings of ancient ruins containing holy relic technology, and who claim the royal prerogative of sole right to salvage their ruins. Poachers are used as test subjects for their discoveries.
-Ruler (Male): Lord High Salvager
-Ruler (Female): Lady High Salvager
-Heir (Male): Rust Knight
-Heir (Female): Scrap Dame

Otherworldly Governments

Eldricht Illegislature: This government appears to be a republic with a democratically elected legislature, but as far as anyone can tell it operates not so much by passing laws as by repealing them... even laws that don't exist. This doesn't seem to stop people from being relieved of punishments for their impossible uncrimes once the nonexistent laws are repealed, though.
-Ruler: Repealer-in-Chief

Occultistocracy: This government flaunts the ostentatious norms of an elitist society. There is a clear pecking order in as much as the more someone is seen, the less power they wield. Consequentially, the more important a decision is to society, the less transparent the decision-making process. From what can be observed, increasingly important governing deliberations are kept increasingly out of sight for good reason.
-Ruler (Male): Invisible Prince
-Ruler (Female): Invisible Princess

Church of Unorthodoxy: This government is a strict state religion, or so it would appear at first glance. In actuality, power seems to reside with the sect or denomination that deviates most sharply from what one may charitably call 'official doctrine.' The most powerful heretic from the most unorthodox faction reigns, but this eventually establishes a new orthodoxy and so the grounds to appoint a new ruler.
-Ruler: Heresiarch

Arcane Despotism: This government superficially resembles a bureaucratic totalitarian state: heavily involved in all aspects of life, with a bewildering array of forms, permissions, clearances, and bribes needed to get anything done. What's odd is that this apparatus doesn't exist simply to contain dissent and enhance state power. It embraces the deviant and the criminal. There are forms to fill out to commit vandalism, career aptitude exams that may sort students into licensed revolutionary opposition, and even a department where citizens can (with great perseverance) apply to depose the dictator.
-Ruler: Provisionally Licensed Dictator

Obscene Court: This government, like many monarchies, sees struggles over succession. Unlike most monarchies, these struggles tend to take the form of providing various pretexts, often quite gruesome and depraved, to avoid being next in line for the throne. The unspeakably wretched state of the monarch once the coronation ritual is complete provides ample explanation why. More unsettling still is the fact that no matter how horrible their degradation or how deep their sorrow, its monarchs never take their own lives.
-Ruler: Abyssal Inheritor
-Heir: Unfortunate Scion

Aspirant Governments

Parliament of Ascent: This government is a political project with a daring purpose. Its democratically-elected leadership oversees the creation of an empire that can embody society's most cherished cultural values and act as a shining beacon for all the galaxy and an example of the best that sapient life can achieve.
-Ruler: Aspirational Rector

Aspirational Council: This government is a political project with a daring purpose. The members of its ruling council are the architects of a future empire that can embody society's most cherished cultural values and act as a shining beacon for all the galaxy and an example of the best that sapient life can achieve.
-Ruler: Purpose Adjudicator

Audacity Regime: This government is a political project with a daring purpose. Its supreme leader has sworn to found an empire that can embody society's most cherished cultural values and act as a shining beacon for all the galaxy and an example of the best that sapient life can achieve.
-Ruler: First Ascendant

Rising Empire: This government is a political project with a daring purpose. Its reigning dynasty has made it a point of royal honor to someday rule over an empire that can embody society's most cherished cultural values and act as a shining beacon for all the galaxy and an example of the best that sapient life can achieve."
-Ruler (Male): Emperor-Ascendant
-Ruler (Female): Empress-Ascendant
-Heir (Male): Promised Prince
-Heir (Female): Promised Princess

Figurehead Monarchy Governments

Parliamentary Monarchy: This government is the result of a monarchy gradually ceding more and more power to an irregular lawmaking body until it becomes not just the regular legislature, but the de-facto government. The monarchy still has a ceremonial and cultural role and while some radicals resent even this, most citizens can't find it in them to care about a mostly harmless family of national mascots.
-Ruler: Head of Parliament

Senatorial Monarchy: This government is the result of a monarchy gradually ceding more and more power to an advisory council until it becomes not just the wielder of executive power, but the de-facto government. The monarchy still has a ceremonial and cultural role and while some radicals resent even this, most citizens can't find it in them to care about a mostly harmless family of national mascots.
-Ruler: Presiding Senator

Indefinite Regency: This government is legally a monarchy in which sovereignty resides in a hereditary ruling family. However, actual governing power has been delegated to a council of appointed ministers for so long that the monarch is a figurehead that is expected to defer to a perpetual regent. The monarchy still has a ceremonial and cultural role and while some radicals resent even this, most citizens can't find it in them to care about a mostly harmless family of national mascots.
-Ruler: Regent

Sortition Governments

Demarchy: This government elects its leadership and governing officials from a candidate pool drawn at random from the general population of all citizens, expressing a radical commitment to equality and aversion to tyrannical concentrations of power. Its supreme leader in war and diplomacy is selected in this way as well.
-Ruler: Polemarch

3. Known Issues

-In the base game, certain events (the Prethoryn and Unbidden crises, most critically) check to see if the player has certain set defined governments to determine what response to give. However, the default "OK" response doesn't start the crisis events. This means that if you're using any mod-added governments, it doesn't seem that you can start the crises. Fortunately, there is a mod out there that fixes this: Event Bugfixes by ECHO (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=785269836)

4. Future Plans

WARNING: I haven't exactly tested any of these in new games. So please do tell me if anything is broken, or unbalanced, or you have a better idea for something. It's very WIP right now. Honestly, the complexity and scope of these civics leads me to believe that a lot of them may be pretty broken! Tell me about it.
