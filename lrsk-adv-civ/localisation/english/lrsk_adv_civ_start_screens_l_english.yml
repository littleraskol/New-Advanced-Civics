 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_TECHNOBARB_COMMON_1:0 "In the before times, our heroic ancestors walked with the gods, and the gods were good to them, and gifted them with every useful art and tool. Our ancestors await us in the afterlife and the gods are gone, but their power is still with us in the great machines."
 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_TECHNOBARB_COMMON_2:0 "when we take to the sky on divine wings and crusade between the stars, seeking the gods wherever they have hidden."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_CYBERSHAMAN_CONCLAVE:0 "$LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_TECHNOBARB_COMMON_1$ Our wise cyber-shamans recently returned from their revels in the beyond and say they can now foresee the day $LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_TECHNOBARB_COMMON_2$"

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_OTHERWORLDLY_COMMON:0 "There was a time, a happier time, when we did not Know. Or perhaps it hasn't happened yet. Perhaps ignorance still blesses us. No, no, do not dare to hope. Know and Know alone the many dooms that shall befall us when the stars leak blood and all planets burn."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_ELDRICHT_ILLEGISLATURE:0 "$LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_OTHERWORLDLY_COMMON$ But there is time yet for some good to be done! Let us gather together. Let us take a vote. What mistakes shall we undo? Perhaps we shall permit fraud. Perhaps murder shall no longer be a crime. Perhaps gravity may be repealed. Perhaps we will unlight the stars themselves."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_OCCULTISTOCRACY:0 "$LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_OTHERWORLDLY_COMMON$ Away, now, away! The unheard bell tolls, can you not hear the cats screaming?

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_CHURCH_OF_UNORTHODOXY:0 "$LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_OTHERWORLDLY_COMMON$ Such idle chatter is blasphemy, anyway. And so we must accept the penalty of command, for the outrages which we have committed against the Truth entitle us to rule. Dip the sacred symbols in sewage, they are wretched to all good clean eyes, wretched!"

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_ARCANE_DESPOTISM:0 "$LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_OTHERWORLDLY_COMMON$ Unless one is a properly licensed Inspirational Demagogue, of course. Then one may chatter the day away about how the doom is but a figment of state propaganda and that we suffer under tyranny for no purpose, and hope there's anyone around with an unexpired permit to listen. We can stand side-by-side on the barricades once our request to the Department of Insurrection to have a riot and standoff with the police clears. "

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_OBSCENE_COURT:0 "$LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_OTHERWORLDLY_COMMON$ Our poor suffering sovereign Knows this all too well. See how It strains to utter a plea for the mercy of death without a tongue, see how It limps through the court, shuddering and twitching, see how Its deformities make It unable to even sit the throne without falling over. All hail our great royal martyr! There but for the gulf of time go we all."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_ASPIRANT_OPEN:0 "From the beginning we were in Ascent: from the muck to thinking life to civilization, always looking up at the stars and wanting more.

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_DEMARCHY:0 "We are a liberty-loving people. Time and again, though, ambitious leaders would use their prestige and positions to accumulate power and enthrone themselves as tyrants. We came to realize that if we want liberty, we must believe in equality. All citizens are liable to public service now. And because all citizens are equal, all candidates for office are appointed at random, stifling the ambitious and empowering the common person."
