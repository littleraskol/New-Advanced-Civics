 # Techno-Barbarian

 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_cybershaman_conclave:0 "Cyber-Shaman Conclave"
 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_cybershaman_conclave_desc:0 "This government is a loose collection of tribes united in their veneration of old ruins and the holy relic tech within. Their most skilled interpreters of the signs and sounds and instruction manuals of ancient technology guide the society's industry and salvage-research."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_HIGH_CYBERSEER:0 "Chief Cyber-Seer"
 LRSK_ADV_CIV_HIGH_CYBERSEER_FEMALE:0 "$LRSK_ADV_CIV_HIGH_CYBERSEER$"

 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_machine_cult:0 "Machine Cult"
 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_machine_cult_desc:0 "This government is a kind of cargo-cult church of relic technology. The cyber-clergy enforce the strict rites of usage and repair necessary to safely operate the old devices. Oddly, for some reason nearly all the successful rituals contain the instruction 'press the ON button' at some point."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_TECHNOPHANT:0 "Technophant"
 LRSK_ADV_CIV_TECHNOPHANT_FEMALE:0 "$LRSK_ADV_CIV_TECHNOPHANT$"

 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_devicomancer_dynasty:0 "Devicomancer Dynasty"
 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_devicomancer_dynasty_desc:0 "This government is centered on a family line of 'devicomancers' who posses vast holdings of ancient ruins containing holy relic technology, and who claim the royal prerogative of sole right to salvage their ruins. Poachers are used as test subjects for their discoveries."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_RT_LORD_HIGH_SALVAGER:0 "Lord High Salvager"
 LRSK_ADV_CIV_RT_LADY_HIGH_SALVAGER:0 "Lady High Salvager"

 # Otherworldly

 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_eldricht_illegislature:0 "Eldricht Illegislature"
 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_eldricht_illegislature_desc:0 "This government appears to be a republic with a democratically elected legislature, but as far as anyone can tell it operates not so much by passing laws as by repealing them... even laws that don't exist. This doesn't seem to stop people from being relieved of punishments for their impossible uncrimes once the nonexistent laws are repealed, though."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_RT_REPEALER_IN_CHIEF:0 "Repealer-in-Chief"
 LRSK_ADV_CIV_RT_REPEALER_IN_CHIEF_FEMALE:0 "$LRSK_ADV_CIV_RT_REPEALER_IN_CHIEF$"

 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_occultistocracy:0 "Occultistocracy"
 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_occultistocracy_desc:0 "This government flaunts the ostentatious norms of an elitist society. There is a clear pecking order in as much as the more someone is seen, the less power they wield. Consequentially, the more important a decision is to society, the less transparent the decision-making process. From what can be observed, increasingly important governing deliberations are kept increasingly out of sight for good reason."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_RT_INVISIBLE_PRINCE:0 "Invisible Prince"
 LRSK_ADV_CIV_RT_INVISIBLE_PRINCEESS:0 "Invisible Princess"

 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_church_of_unorthodoxy:0 "Church of Unorthodoxy"
 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_church_of_unorthodoxy_desc:0 "This government is a strict state religion, or so it would appear at first glance. In actuality, power seems to reside with the sect or denomination that deviates most sharply from what one may charitably call 'official doctrine.' The most powerful heretic from the most unorthodox faction reigns, but this eventually establishes a new orthodoxy and so the grounds to appoint a new ruler."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_RT_HERESIARCH:0 "Heresiarch"
 LRSK_ADV_CIV_RT_HERESIARCH_FEMALE:0 "$LRSK_ADV_CIV_RT_HERESIARCH$"

 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_arcane_despotism:0 "Arcane Despotism"
 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_arcane_despotism_desc:0 "This government superficially resembles a bureaucratic totalitarian state: heavily involved in all aspects of life, with a bewildering array of forms, permissions, clearances, and bribes needed to get anything done. What's odd is that this governing apparatus doesn't exist to quash dissent and enhance state power. It embraces the deviant and the criminal. There are forms to fill out to commit vandalism, career aptitude exams that may sort students into licensed revolutionary opposition, and even a department where citizens can (with great perseverance) apply to depose the dictator."

 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_obscene_court:0 "Obscene Court"
 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_obscene_court_desc:0 "This government, like many monarchies, sees struggles over succession. Unlike most monarchies, these struggles tend to take the form of providing various pretexts, often quite gruesome and depraved, to avoid being next in line for the throne. The unspeakably wretched state of the monarch once the coronation ritual is complete provides ample explanation why. More unsettling still is the fact that no matter how horrible their degradation or how deep their sorrow, its monarchs never take their own lives."

 # Parl-Mon

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_GOV_VESTIGE_MONARCHY:0 "The monarchy still has a ceremonial and cultural role and while some radicals resent even this, most citizens can't find it in them to care about a mostly harmless family of national mascots."

 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_parliamentary_monarchy:0 "Parliamentary Monarchy"
 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_parliamentary_monarchy_desc:0 "This government is the result of a monarchy gradually ceding more and more power to an irregular lawmaking body until it becomes not just the regular legislature, but the de-facto government. $LRSK_ADV_CIV_GOV_VESTIGE_MONARCHY$"

 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_puppet_parliament:0 "Puppet Parliament"
 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_puppet_parliament_desc:0 "This government operates as if it were a representative democratic state with a vestigial, figurehead monarchy. However, the monarchy is not nearly so toothless as it seems and the royal dynasty effectively runs the government by orchestrating key elections and exerting pressure on important members of parliament. Most notice but few discuss the fact that relatives of the dynasty do well in elections and appointments."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_HEAD_OF_PARLIAMENT:0 "Head of Parliament"
 LRSK_ADV_CIV_HEAD_OF_PARLIAMENT_FEMALE:0 "$LRSK_ADV_CIV_HEAD_OF_PARLIAMENT$"

 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_senatorial_monarchy:0 "Senatorial Monarchy"
 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_senatorial_monarchy_desc:0 "This government is the result of a monarchy gradually ceding more and more power to an advisory council until it becomes not just the collective wielder of executive power, but the de-facto government. $LRSK_ADV_CIV_GOV_VESTIGE_MONARCHY$"

 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_puppet_senate:0 "Puppet Senate"
 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_puppet_senate_desc:0 "This government operates as if it were a republic that has supplanted a defuct monarchy. However, the royal dynasty has not vanished and indeed effectively runs the government by bribing, cajoling, threatening, seducing, or otherwise influencing the most powerful senators. Indeed, blood or married relation to the dynasty and high office tend to go hand-in-hand suspiciously often."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_PRESIDING_SENATOR:0 "Presiding Senator"
 LRSK_ADV_CIV_PRESIDING_SENATORFEMALE:0 "$LRSK_ADV_CIV_PRESIDING_SENATOR$"

 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_indefinite_regency:0 "Indefinite Regency"
 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_indefinite_regency_desc:0 "This government is legally a monarchy in which sovereignty resides in a hereditary ruling family. However, actual governing power has been delegated to a council of appointed ministers for so long that the monarch is a figurehead that is expected to defer to a perpetual regent. $LRSK_ADV_CIV_GOV_VESTIGE_MONARCHY$"

 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_scapegoat_regency:0 "Scapegoat Regency"
 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_scapegoat_regency_desc:0 "This government is legally a monarchy, but the monarch directly wields no power and seems to be a mere figurehead. Instead, a regent appointed by a ministerial council makes most important decisions - taking all responsibility and thus all the blame. Neither the decisions nor the appointment of the regent, however, can happen without the consent of the monarch, and the monarch is quite strident in asserting the dynasty's interests in all matters of government."

 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_demarchy:0 "Demarchy"
 lrsk_adv_civ_gov_demarchy_desc:0 "This government elects its leadership and governing officials from a candidate pool drawn at random from the general population of all citizens, expressing a radical commitment to equality and aversion to tyrannical concentrations of power. Its supreme leader in war and diplomacy is selected in this way as well."
