 ### QCC - Quasi-Collective Consciousness ###

 lrsk_adv_civ_quasicollective_consciousness:0 "Quasi-Collective Consciousness"
 lrsk_adv_civ_quasicollective_consciousness_desc:0 "Quasi-Collective Consciousnesses are societies organized like artificial hive minds, and act the same way: concerned with the propagation of their species above all else, benign given room to expand, genocidally aggressive when hemmed in."

 LRSK_QCC_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "You stand in the way of the [Root.GetName]. Whatever you wish to discuss, reconcile yourselves with the inevitability of our advance."
 LRSK_QCC_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "The lives of all outside the [Root.GetName] are secondary, but those of the vile [From.GetName] are tertiary."
 LRSK_QCC_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Your collective is a lie. With time, you will reveal yourselves as a confused mass of discord."

 LRSK_QCC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We are the [Root.GetName]. Choose your words carefully, you stand before us all."
 LRSK_QCC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "We can only hope that you speak for all of [From.GetName], as this vessel is the voice of every member of the [Root.GetName]."
 LRSK_QCC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "You have taken steps on the journey to unity, but are you prepared to devote yourself as we have?"
 LRSK_QCC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "We can hear the cacophony of voices echoing beyond yours, this dissonance in the [From.GetSpeciesName] consciousness. How can you bear it?"

 LRSK_QCC_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "We have not known conflict amongst ourselves for eons. We hope you will never bring it to us."

 LRSK_QCC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "The [Root.GetName] greets you, [From.GetRulerTitle]. Although you are not part of us, you will come to know that we value our friends as well."
 LRSK_QCC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "We like to think of you as honorary members of the [Root.GetName], living in the imperfect but important harmony known as 'alliance.'"
 LRSK_QCC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "The [From.GetName] and the [Root.GetName] will act as proof that societies striving for internal unanimity will coexist peacefully."
 LRSK_QCC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "Despite your relentless focus on your internal division into 'persons,' we are confident in our trust in the [From.GetName] as a whole."

 LRSK_QCC_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "All obstacles to the [Root.GetAdj] must be eliminated. As beings of singular but functional sentience, you have the choice not to be an obstacle."
 LRSK_QCC_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "We are the [Root.GetName]. Lower your shields and surrender your ships."
 LRSK_QCC_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "While each death we inflict upon you is a lonely life lost, each one you inflict upon us cuts away part of our being. Can you feel yourselves dying as we can?"
 LRSK_QCC_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "A horde of lower creatures with separate wills will never defeat the indivisible determination of the [Root.GetName]."

 LRSK_QCC_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "Why must our great mind do the bidding of a such a failed society?"

 LRSK_QCC_DOW_SELECT:0 "Taking up arms against the [Root.GetName] is not done lightly, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 LRSK_QCC_DOW_PROPOSE:0 "This is a declaration of war. Assimilation is mandatory."
