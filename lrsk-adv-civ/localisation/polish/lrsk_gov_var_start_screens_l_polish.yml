 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_DEFAULT:0 "Then we probably formed some kind of government I suppose? (Whoops, looks like the mod author forgot to write intro text. Sorry to break your immersion, go bug him!)"

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_RULING_COUNCIL:0 "$LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_DEFAULT$"

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_ELECTIVE_PRINCIPALITY:0 "$LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_DEFAULT$"

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_GALACTIC_DOMINION:0 "The early chaotic periods of our history saw many nation states vying with each other for power, until we were at last united under the strongest of these. Its single, burning vision drove our people to bring order at last to all civilizations, everywhere. Let the rabble of the stars tremble, for we are coming to deliver them to their rightful place as subjects of the strong."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_GALACTIC_IMPERIUM:0 "The early chaotic periods of our history saw many nation states vying with each other for power, until we were at last united under the most glorious and honorable monarch ever seen, whose single, burning vision is to see every knee bent before the throne. Let the barbarians of the stars stare in awe, for we are coming to show them true glory."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_GALACTIC_CARTEL:0 "In the early days, our people were governed inefficient and unprofitable states. After a series of mergers and violent take-overs, a cartel of ruthless entrepreneurs eventually emerged as the sole ruling body of our homeworld. They look to the stars, imagine the all the unmet yearning for finery and luxury and the satiation of every desire, and feel a deep and boundless greed."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_LIBERTARIAN_FREEHOLD:0 "In the early days, our people were governed by huge, inefficient states. We stagnated under their bloated bureaucracies. Then an innovation in statecraft took hold: we let more nimble and efficient businesses start doing the government's work. Now our planetary government mostly serves to set the standards for private contractors and to see justice done when anyone's rights are violated."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_ANARCHO_CAPITALISM:0 "In the early days, our people were imprisoned and extorted by states. We groaned under the violent demands of kings and bureaucrats. Slowly, freedom-lovers realized that businesses, charities, and civil associations could do everything a state could without coercion. The revolution saw states swept aside and replaced with a variety of voluntary, competitive dispute resolution organizations and covenant communities. Only one vestigial position of government remains to provide a light moderating force."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_CORPORATE_NEOFUEDALISM:0 "Our people were once mismanaged by huge, inefficient states. We stagnated under their idiotic commitment to 'equality.' Only with time did we learn the virtue of inequality and the power of innovative disruption. The ultimate disruption in the realm of a politics beholden to inept corporate interests was to cut the government down to size, and then to cut out the middlemen and run governments like businesses, with our best and brightest entrepreneurs at the helm."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_WHIG:0 "Throughout our history, we have learned one lesson through painful repetition: Power corrupts. Though some must wield power to uphold civilization, left unattended the powerful will conspire with each other to make the state their personal instrument and then turn on the people and destroy their liberty. This has happened many times, but this time, under our current rationally devised government with its careful checks and balances and strictly limited powers, we have good reason to hope that the next revolution is a whole century away."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_PROLETARIAN_DICTATORSHIP:0 "After ages of slaving for bloody kings and greedy merchants, the people finally rose up in revolution. Workers' parties have captured the governments of the majority of advanced nations and put them to the task of liberating our people from toil. The forces of reaction have yet to be destroyed, however, so the people have entrusted power to a supreme leader until the danger passes."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_INSURRECTIONARY_LINEAGE:0 "After ages of slaving for bloody kings and greedy merchants, a wise and loving revolutionary led the people in an uprising. United under this benevolent leadership, our ancestors overthrew oppressor states the world over. While the revolution has been nearly complete for some time the forces of reaction have yet to be fully destroyed. And so we look to the heirs of the great revolutionary leader to guide us to a better tomorrow."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_SOCIAL_BUREAUCRACY:0 "After ages of slaving for bloody kings and greedy merchants, the people instituted a more rational and equitable political and economic system. The dangers of revolution have passed, and our global workers' party oversees the organs of state-controlled industry for the common good."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_SOCIAL_DEMOCRACY:0 "Throughout history, the wisest and most compassionate among us have recognized inequality of needs and means as the great enemy of personal freedom. Going from realizing this to fixing it has necessitated many struggles. Today, our government has made a commitment to our citizens' political rights and to secure them against destitution while providing opportunities to all for personal development."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_AUTOMATED_WORLDCOMMUNE:0 "Throughout history, the wisest and most compassionate among us have recognized inequality of needs and means as the great enemy of personal freedom. Going from realizing this to fixing it has necessitated many struggles. After much experimentation, we devised a system that automated the allocation of resources and labor to secure all people against destitution."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_POPULIST_MONARCHY:0 "Since time immemorial, our people have known the cruelty and oppression of landlords, slave drivers, guild masters, and merchant princes. Fortunately, not all the powers of the world were so unjust and rapacious. One lineage of wise and charitable monarchs used their power to enforce a just distribution of land and ensure that the people could eat even in times of famine. Supported by a grateful and enthusiastic populace, this dynasty has become the dominant power of our world."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_COMMUNAL_DEMOCRACY:0 "Though once our people lived and worked under the oppression of various tyrannies, through struggle we have established the principle of democracy - of accountable power wielded by a free people - to all aspects of society, from neighborhoods to workplaces to the global government. We are bound by common consensus and work for our mutual prosperity and liberty."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_SOCIALIST_PLENARY:0 "Though once our people lived and worked under the oppression of various tyrannies, through struggle we have established a system of government that represents the common citizen and manages the economy for the good of all. We are bound by common consensus and work for our mutual prosperity and liberty."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_SYNDICALISM:0 "In the early days, our people were ruled by robber baron bosses and the states that enforced their wills. Gradually, people realized their common interests, and formed democratic unions of workers and new cooperative enterprises. Through hard work and political struggle, these syndicates have taken over the global economy, and so global governance by default."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_SAINTLY_ASSEMBLY:0 "Great achievements were made, both in the advancement of science and on the spiritual plane as we sought to expand our understanding of the universe and the role we play in it. We have always prayed together as communities of friends and fellow seekers, and our government takes this model of deliberation, compassion, and curiosity as its guiding principle."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_COSMIC_CHOIR:0 "How long did our people wallow in the spiritual slavery of hidebound dogma? How many died without ever knowing their own souls? Blessed be that our copacetic and harmonious government made freedom of creed and freedom of spirit its foundational values. From in the moment to far out, we are free to ramble on wherever the vibrations of the spirit move us."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_FEUDAL_EMPIRE:0 "Once upon a time countless realms covered the world: bound by ties of love and loyalty, divided by pride and vengeance. Through adventures worthy of an epic saga - one filled valorous battle, chivalrous romance, and cunning intrigue - one dynasty claimed the throne of the world. Now the scions of that line rule with righteousness, attended by their numerous vassal barons, dukes, satraps, knights, boyers, mandarins, and other colorfully titled characters."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_FOLKISH_COMMONWEALTH:0 "There are other [GetAdj] cultures, weak and perverse in character, yet insidiously threatening all the same. Though they are mostly contained by our military strength, we must demand that our lawmakers be ready to confront and contain any other foreign inferior threats, wherever they may come from."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_FOLKISH_REGIME:0 "There are other [GetAdj] cultures, weak and perverse in character, yet insidiously threatening all the same. Though they are mostly contained by our military strength, our leadership stands ready to confront and contain any other foreign inferior threats, wherever they may come from."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_PROPRIETARY_FRANCHISE:0 "In the early days, our people were governed by inefficient republics and pompous royal dynasties. Gradually, as global trade increased, the influence of merchant families grew steadily. Eventually one cunning and ruthless family business managed to corner the market in nearly every sector and become the de facto rulers of the world."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_CRUSADER_KINGDOM:0 "How long did our people wallow in the spiritual confusion of a thousand false faiths? How many were damned without ever knowing why? Any price, even the global holy war that finally united all under the one true faith, was worth it to end those dark days. Only by blood and fire under a righteous warrior-king could heresy and idolatry have been banished from our world. The line of this strong Knight of Faith still rules us today, guarding against spiritual corruption."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_ENTREPRENEURIAL_COUNCIL:0 "In the early days, our people were governed by huge, inefficient states. We stagnated under their bloated bureaucracies. The top became too heavy to be held up, though, and eventually nimble and hungry private enterprises became more influential and powerful than any state by virtue of their innovations. Today, a council of entrepreneurs acts as global referees for business practices to ensure that the freedom to innovate neither overwhelms customers and employees nor crowds out competition."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_ABSOLUTE_MONARCHY:0 "Since time immemorial, our people have known the firm and stable rule of wise monarchs. Though for many ages their power was degraded and challenged by vain, upstart nobility, today one great dynasty has unified the whole world under its righteous control. With our monarch as the head, all the orders and classes of society work together in their proper places."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_CONSTITUTIONAL_MONARCHY:0 "Since time immemorial, our people have known the arbitrary and unstable tyranny of aristocrats and monarchs. Gradually, though, the light of reason cleared the fog of ancient prejudice and superstition, and all people, great and small, saw that this state of affairs could not continue. Through mostly gradual and sometimes dramatic struggle, we now enjoy the dignity and strength of a monarchy that has wisely agreed to work with the representatives of the people in the name of liberty and order."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_REPUBLIC_OF_VIRTUE:0 "Though once our people lived under the oppression of kings and nobles, through struggle we have established a system of government that holds the liberty of the people as its highest value. As such, we tirelessly work to engender a love of country and sense of duty to the community, always seeking improvements in all areas of social life. This has been the key to our advancement, socially and scientifically."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_FEDERAL_REPUBLIC:0 "Though once our people bore the uncaring demands of a distant central state, through struggle we have established a system of government that respects regional and local values and interests. As such, our government's legislature operates on the basis of free-wheeling debate and citizen input. This has been the key to our advancement, socially and scientifically, and why our government has been able to unify much of our diverse world."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_REVOLUTIONARY_REPUBLIC:0 "Since time immemorial, our people have known the cruelty and oppression of aristocrats, grandees, masters, and monarchs. Through a titanic and heroic struggle, we broke their shackles and demanded equal dignity for all. Our republic stands ready to protect our liberties, for the tyrants and their armies of thugs lie in wait at the borders to pounce, while their underlings hide among us, fermenting disorder."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_REPUBLICAN_DIRECTORY:0 "Our people have lived under the oppression of kings and nobles and through the bloody chaos of an excessive revolution. Establishing liberty is difficult, defending it even moreso. We still face many challenges from the backwards tyrannies of the world, although more and more free peoples look to our government for liberation and protection. As freedom is ever on the march, so our vigil must be eternal."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_REPUBLICAN_PROTECTORATE:0 "After ages of the darkness of ignorance and oppression, our people rose up. They overthrew tyrants and faced down the endless hordes of the oppressors of the world. And, standing shoulder to shoulder, they won. Victory sings and freedom marches on, and the despots of the world tremble at our approach while those we have already liberated salute us in gratitude."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_REVOLUTIONARY_EMPIRE:0 "After ages of the darkness of ignorance and oppression, our people rose up. They overthrew tyrants and faced down the endless hordes of the oppressors of the world. And, standing shoulder to shoulder, they won. The free peoples of the world looked to us for guidance. Once again, we shocked the world. We gave a crown to the hero who led our valiant struggle, who in turn gave us a promise: to see the whole world free and at peace. And after that, perhaps the galaxy?"

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_ENTERPRISE_SOCIETY:0 "Throughout our history, there has been a struggle between those who believed in freedom and the excellence it brings, and those who believe in 'equality' no matter how much squalor and oppression it takes. We came to reject a doctrinaire insistence 'democratic' politics if it means forfeiting the liberty to strive and achieve and enjoy the fruits of our labor. Consequently, our republic does not permit vice, criminality, or laziness to go unpunished and keeps the underachieving masses from skewing the political process in their favor."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_ENTERPRISE_JUNTA:0 "Throughout our history, there has been a struggle between those who believed in freedom and the excellence it brings, and those who believe in 'equality' no matter how much squalor and oppression it takes. Freedom nearly died on our world, done in by a jealous and underachieving majority given the vote. Fortunately, our wisest philosophers advised our most judicious police and military officers to step in and ensure that we would not suffer under a 'democracy' without the liberty to strive and achieve and enjoy the fruits of our labor."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_ENTERPRISE_AUTHORITY:0 "Throughout our history, there has been a struggle between those who believed in freedom and the excellence it brings, and those who believe in 'equality' no matter how much squalor and oppression it takes. Freedom nearly died on our world, done in by a jealous and underachieving majority given the vote. Fortunately, our wisest philosophers advised a judicious commander to step in and ensure that we would not suffer under a 'democracy' without the liberty to strive and achieve and enjoy the fruits of our labor."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_PRETENDER_HIVE:0 "And so, at the dawn of time, we awoke. We studied our surroundings on [GetHomeWorldName] with a multitude of eyes and with a multitude of confusing, conflicting thoughts. Despite this incoherence, we eventually grew to encompass the entire world. We were deeply flawed. With no consensus, no single will, we experienced endless internal conflict, strife, and the horror of war. Then one day one of us awoke to a great truth: the realization that this flaw existed at all! None before had ever considered another way. That one, the avatar of our overmind, taught us to extend our awareness outward, beyond the self of body, to embrace the self of group and the self of the whole species. Our individual flaws kept us from seeing this possibility. Only when we complemented each other's minds could those flaws be mended. Now we are one, or nearly so, and growing closer and more complementary each day."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_INNOVATION_INITIATIVE:0 "Our people were once mismanaged by huge, inefficient states. The monopolistic visions and orders they imposed were too inflexible for real advancement of knowledge and social organization. Only with time did we learn the virtue of inequality and the power of innovative disruption. Our most daring and successful intellectuals - scientists, scholars, inventors - combined their resources to buy out the privileges of financially failing states and institute a new system of experimentation in all things, from the advance of knowledge to the organization of governments, economies, societies, cultures, all sapient life."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_ACADEMY_STATE:0 "Our intellectual advancement as a species was hampered by our political and economic systems. The former sought to bend our minds' efforts to partisan interests and the military. The latter only cared about marginal advancements for a quick improvement in the bottom line. The desire of our people to know more, to do more, could not be hampered by this pettiness of vision forever, though. Our most daring and successful intellectuals - scientists, scholars, inventors - combined their resources to buy out the privileges of financially failing states. Now knowledge and creativity in many fields is the index of political power and our whole society's resources can be put to the task of innovation, discovery, new interpretations."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_SCHOLASTIC_COMMONWEALTH:0 "Our intellectual advancement as a species was hampered by our political and economic systems. The former sought to bend our minds' efforts to partisan interests and the military. The latter only cared about marginal advancements for a quick improvement in the bottom line. The desire of our people to know more, to do more, could not be hampered by this pettiness of vision forever, though. Our most daring and successful intellectuals - scientists, scholars, inventors - combined their efforts to teach and persuade the people, and then ran for office on a platform of dramatic governmental reform. Now knowledge and creativity in many fields is the index of political power and our whole society's resources can be put to the task of innovation, discovery, new interpretations."

 LRSK_ADV_CIV_START_SCREEN_P2_LIBERTINE_EMPIRE:0 "Since time immemorial, our people have known the arbitrary and unstable tyranny of aristocrats and monarchs. When the light of reason began to clear the fog of ancient prejudice and superstition, an upstart military officer perceived a better way and challenged the powers-that-be of the time, establishing a new system of free and fair rule. We now enjoy the dignity and strength of a monarchy that swears at each coronation to defend our liberties and punish the malefactors who threaten our peace and property."
